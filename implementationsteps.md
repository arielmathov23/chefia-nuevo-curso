## Stage 1: Initial Setup
1. **Create Project Structure**:
   - Initialize a new Next.js project: 
     ```bash
     npx create-next-app chefia
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd chefia
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
     npx tailwindcss init -p
     ```
   - Configure Tailwind CSS in `tailwind.config.js` and include it in the global CSS file.

2. **Setup Directory Structure**:
   - Create a `src/` directory and within it, create `components/`, `pages/`, and `api/` directories.
   - Ensure no nested directories exist by keeping components flat and organized.

3. **Implement Basic Layout**:
   - Create a basic layout component in `src/components/Layout.js` to wrap all pages.
   - Implement a simple homepage in `src/pages/index.js` to test the application runs locally.

4. **Run Application Locally**:
   - Start the Next.js development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Verify that the application is accessible on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Stage 2: Feature Implementation
1. **Ingredient Input Interface**:
   - Create `src/components/IngredientInput.js` for users to input ingredients.
   - Implement state management using React hooks to capture user input.

2. **Recipe Suggestion Engine**:
   - Create a mock integration for the OpenAI API in `src/api/recipes.js` to simulate recipe suggestions.
   - Develop component `src/components/RecipeSuggestions.js` to display suggested recipes based on input ingredients.

3. **Shopping List Generator**:
   - Develop `src/components/ShoppingList.js` to generate a shopping list based on selected recipes.

4. **User Feedback Mechanism**:
   - Implement a component for user feedback that captures user ratings and comments.

5. **Test Local Features**:
   - Ensure all components are functional and display correctly on the homepage.

## Stage 3: Backend Integration
1. **Setup Node.js Backend**:
   - Create a new directory `backend/` for the Node.js backend.
   - Initialize a new Node.js project:
     ```bash
     npm init -y
     npm install express supabase-js cors
     ```

2. **Implement RESTful API**:
   - Create API routes in `backend/routes/ingredients.js`, `backend/routes/recipes.js`, etc.
   - Implement CRUD operations for ingredients and recipes.

3. **Integrate Supabase**:
   - Set up Supabase by creating tables for Users, Ingredients, Recipes, Preferences, and Shopping Lists.
   - Use Supabase client to interact with the database from the backend.

4. **Implement Authentication**:
   - Use JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions.
   - Protect sensitive routes using middleware.

5. **Run Backend Locally**:
   - Start the backend server and ensure it runs on the same port as the frontend.

## Stage 4: Finalization and Testing
1. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the interaction between frontend and backend to ensure data flows correctly.
   - Mock external service calls where necessary for testing.

2. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on UI/UX.
   - Implement modifications based on user feedback.

3. **Prepare for Deployment**:
   - Configure Vercel for deployment.
   - Ensure environment variables (API keys, database URLs) are set securely.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application to Vercel and verify that all features work in the production environment.

5. **Monitor and Iterate**:
   - Monitor application performance and user feedback post-launch.
   - Plan for future iterations based on user engagement and success metrics.
