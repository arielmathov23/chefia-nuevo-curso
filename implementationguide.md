## Project Overview
ChefIA is a web application designed to assist young individuals (ages 18-30) in managing their kitchen inventory and receiving recipe suggestions based on available ingredients. The application aims to reduce food waste and promote healthier eating habits by utilizing real-time ingredient input and recipe generation powered by OpenAI.

## High-Level Architectural Decisions
- **Microservices Architecture**: The application will adopt a microservices approach to enhance scalability and maintainability.
- **Frontend**: 
  - **Framework**: Next.js for server-side rendering and improved SEO.
  - **UI Library**: Tailwind CSS for a modern, utility-first styling approach.
- **Backend**: 
  - **Environment**: Node.js and Express.js for a non-blocking, efficient server-side experience.
  - **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for an easy-to-use relational database with built-in authentication features.
- **Deployment**: Vercel for seamless integration with Next.js and automatic scaling.

## Code Structure
- Place all source code in the `src/` directory.
- Use App Router for routing.
- Avoid nested directory issues by organizing components and pages logically.
- Use Turbopack for local development (`next dev`), maintaining the default import alias (`@/*`).

## Managing Contrast, Accessibility, and Responsive Design
- Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and backgrounds.
- Implement ARIA roles and properties for dynamic content.
- Test for keyboard navigability throughout the application.
- Design with a mobile-first approach, ensuring all components are responsive.

## Conclusion
ChefIA aims to provide a seamless user experience by integrating various technologies and adhering to best practices in development. By focusing on accessibility and responsive design, the application will cater to a wide range of users, ensuring that meal planning is efficient and enjoyable.
